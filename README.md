# Customer Object Management

Customer Object Management is a RESTful API-based project built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This project allows for the management of customer details through a series of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). The API is secure, allowing only authenticated users to interact with the endpoints.

## Features

- Add, view, update, and delete customer details.
- Supports both single and multiple customer retrieval.
- Authentication and permissions are enforced to restrict access.
- Handles errors like missing customers or invalid data gracefully.
- JSON response format for all API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Django**: Web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: For building the RESTful APIs.
- **SQLite/MySQL**: Database for storing customer data (You can switch to other databases supported by Django).
- **Authentication**: Session-based or Token-based authentication.
- **RESTful Services**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer information via APIs.
